In the middle of the night
When the angels scream
I don't want to live a lie, that I believe
Time to do or die
I will never forget the moment, the moment
I will never forget the moment
And the story goes on on on
That's how the story goes
That's how the story goes
You and I will never die
It's a dark embrace
In the beginning was a light of a dawning age
Time to be alive
I will never forget the moment, the moment
I will never forget this night we sing, we sing
Oh oh oh wow oh
Oh oh oh wow oh
Oh oh oh wow oh
That's how the story goes
Fate is coming, that I know
Time is running, got to go
Fate is coming, that I know
Let it go
Here and now
Under the banner of heaven
We dream out loud
Do or die and the story goes
Oh oh oh wow oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh wow oh
