In the middle of the night
When the angels scream
I don't want to live a lie, that I believe
Time to do or die
I will never forget the moment, the moment
I will never forget the moment
And the story goes on on on
That's how the story goes
That's how the story goes
You and I will never die
It's a dark embrace
In the beginning was a light of a dawning age
Time to be alive
